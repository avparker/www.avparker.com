It's in Yotsuya, only 5 minutes from the nearest subway station, 30 minutes from my work, and about 25 minutes walk from [Shinjuku](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinjuku%2C_Tokyo) Station. The rent sure isn't cheap, but it's quite big and gets plenty of sun, and I didn't have to pay [key money](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_money). The landlord also provided a refridgerator and a washing machine, and curtains - yes, you usually need to buy your own! And it includes free broadband internet as a nice little bonus.
