My hard drive on my macbook failed a few weeks ago. I've resurrected the original hard drive (not the failed one) till I get around to buying a new one. Luckily I had backed up my photos the night before, so I didn't lose anything really important.  Yay for [rsync](http://www.samba.org/rsync/)!

I'm seriously considering getting a [Time Capsule](http://www.apple.com/timecapsule/), since I need a wireless router anyway, and automatic wireless backups would be awesome.
