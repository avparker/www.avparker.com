Now that 2011 is over it's time for me to update my aikido training log.

### Training Summary

After a [strong start to the year]({{root_url}}/2011/07/23/aikido-training-log-first-half-2011/) unfortunately I couldn't train as much as I'd have liked in the second half of the year, training only **114 hours**.

I finished the year with __250.5 hours__, having taken __199 lessons__ on __172 days__. Coincidentally this is the same number of days as I [trained in 2010]({{root_url}}/2010/12/30/aikido-training-2010-summary/), however I trained more hours, an average of 20.9 hours per month compared to 19.5 hours per month in 2010. Not bad considering I "lost" 2 weeks training due to the [Great East Japan Earthquake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_T%C5%8Dhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami), and another week to vacation at the end of the year. Overall I'm pleased, but still hoping to train more next year.

### Teachers for 2011

Over the course of the year I attended classes by 21 different teachers, although the vast majority of my training was in classes by Kobayashi Sensei, Katsurada Sensei, and Suzuki Toshio Sensei.

### Highlights for the second half of the year

-  Taking ukemi for a Obara san's Shodan Test in July. I was quite tired afterwards. I really don't know how Sonobe San (my uke for my test) managed to take ukemi for 3 people in a row!
-  Taking lots of ukemi for my teachers in Advanced Gakko (Kobayashi Sensei and Katsurada Sensei).
-  Last but not least, continuing to be called up by Kobayashi Sensei in ippan class (Hombu 3rd floor). I think he called my up a total of about 5 or 6 times. Each time I was surprised, there are so many people in the class that take better ukemi than me.

### Aikido Highlights for 2011

The highlight was obviously [my shodan test]({{root_url}}/2011/04/09/my-aikido-shodan-test/) in February.

Following that I was lucky to be able to take lots of ukemi for my Teachers (including ippan class at Hombu!) as well as take ukemi for 2-and-a-bit shodan tests.

### Aikido Goals for 2012

My main focus for 2012 is to improve my ukemi. I really need to work on my stretching and improve my flexibility. My aim is to train 180 days in 2012, although I know this will be tough to reach.
