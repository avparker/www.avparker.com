This is the third in a series of posts about the "[Aikido Gakko (Aikido Academy)]({{root_url}}/category/aikido-gakko/)" at [Aikikai Hombu Dojo, Tokyo](http://www.aikikai.or.jp/). After attending [Beginners Gakko]({{root_url}}/2010/03/01/aikikai-hombu-dojo-beginners-gakko/) and [Intermediate Gakko]({{root_url}}/2010/10/14/aikikai-hombu-dojo-tokyo-intermediate-gakko/), I attended "Advanced Gakko" for three semesters, from October 2010 until February 2012.

### Course Overview
Advanced Gakko, or "Advanced Academy" (合気道学校　上級課程) is open to anyone holding 1st Kyuu or higher. You do not need to have taken the earlier levels (beginners or intermediate), but you must sign up before the course begins and places are limited. The course runs in two 5-month semesters per year, April-August and October-February. There are two 90-minute classes a week, Tuesday and Friday evenings, starting at 6:30pm. At the end of the semester students who have attended at least 2/3 of the classes are eligible to receive a graduation certificate and, if you have met the requirements for training time, to take a grading test for shodan (black belt). The classes are taught entirely in Japanese. More information about “Aikido Gakko” is covered on the Aikiaki web site, in <a href="http://www.aikikai.or.jp/eng/hombu/academy.htm">English</a> and in <a href="http://www.aikikai.or.jp/jpn/hombu/academy.htm">Japanese</a>.

### My First Semester
Each level of the "gakko" is different, so I wasn't completely sure what to expect with "Advanced Gakko". One obvious point of focus for the course is the shodan test at the end of the semester, however I had heard that it is not unusual for people to attend many times, and even for 2nd or 3rd dan students to attend. There were 9 or 10 "yudansha" (people with black belts) in the class when I joined, and indeed a couple of them were 2nd dan, and also an excellent 3rd dan student. This meant the classes were a little bit different from the beginners and intermediate levels of the gakko where everyone was a similar level, and more like the regular (3rd floor) classes where you get a mix of experience. As a first kyuu student this was great for me, I was happy to get the chance to train with some higher level students in the familiar "gakko" environment.

The first class was taken by Katsurada Sensei, and I remember being surprised when he went around the room and was taking ukemi. I've seen other teachers do this occasionally, but it is something that Katsurada Sensei does quite often. It seemed to me like a good way to start the classes, I imagine it would help him to get a good idea of everyone's level fairly quickly, and it also provides a good example of ukemi for the students. I also remember the class ending with jiyuwaza, which was something I'd generally only practiced specifically for gradings.

I also remember the start of the second class quite clearly. Kobayashi Sensei started by welcoming us all to the course, talking quite at length before he suddenly noticed that I was in the class and he stopped to check if I understood Japanese, which was very nice of him. After the introduction the class started with forward rolls and shikko (walking on your knees), just like Kobayashi Sensei's Saturday morning beginner classes I took when I started training at Hombu, and just like the class would every week. While I find shikko very hard, it's good practice for me.

The Advanced Gakko classes aren't totally focused on the shodan test, particularly the first half of the semester. The lessons cover many different themes, and I could see the teachers trying to introduce us to different concepts (and I'm sure there's lots I wasn't even aware of). One lesson Katsurada Sensei even brought in some PET bottles that we could use as makeshift tanto ("short knife"), which was an interesting class. I really enjoyed the lessons, and looked forward to class twice a week.

As the end of 2010 approached I started [thinking about taking the shodan test]({{url_root}}/2011/02/18/what-does-shodan-mean/) in February. After a few weeks rest over Christmas and New Year, it was back to training 5 or 6 days a week. The classes became more focused on the shodan tests, concentrating on the kihon techniques and often including jiyuwaza practice towards the end of class. Many of the students aiming to take the shodan test would remain after class to practice with their uke. I wasn't really sure I was ready, it probably would have been better for me to wait, but because I wasn't sure if this would be my last chance to take the test at the gakko I decided to take the test. On February 18th I took [my shodan test]({{root_url}}/2011/04/09/my-aikido-shodan-test/) in the Advanced Gakko grading session, and the following week I recieved my shodan certificate from the Doshu.

### Summer 2011

Just three weeks after the [Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_T%C5%8Dhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami) struck Northern Japan the Summer semester of Advanced Gakko started. The class was full as usual, the earthquake didn't seem to deter people from training at all. After receiving my shodan, I was allowed to wear a hakama. It took me a few months to get used to wearing the hakama, I had to be careful not to trip, especially when standing up. For the first few weeks I was hesitant to attend the regular classes on the third floor, sticking instead to the beginners class on the second floor. I felt that I had been too fast

The other big change for me was that I got called for ukemi by the teachers. It's an amazing experience to take ukemi for the teachers. I find it hard to take in what the teacher is doing while I'm taking ukemi, I'm usually too busy trying to make sure I don't screw up my ukemi and injure myself. But if the sensei goes slow enough I can sometimes to try to feel the sensation of how their techniques feel. This is one of the parts of my experience at the gakko that I am most thankful for.

Towards the end of the semester I was asked to be an uke for one student taking the shodan test. I was honoured, and a bit nervous, to be taking ukemi for a shodan test for the first time. Obara san did a great job, passing with flying colours.

The summer semester was the first time I managed to attended every class (皆勤).


### My Third Semester

I enjoyed the Advanced Gakko so much I decided to sign up for a third semester. Once again I got to take a lot of ukemi for the teachers, which was a fantastic experience. In the February 2012 grading test I took ukemi for two students (that was very tough!). Noguchi san and Kuboyama san both did great.

I would have liked to continue taking the Advanced Gakko classes, but decided it was finally time for me to "graduate". Perhaps I'll be able to take it again in the future.

### Final Words

Advanced Gakko was a fantastic experience.

- teachers are very supportive

Katsurada Sensei and Kobayashi Sensei have very different styles of aikido but they are both excellent teachers. The classes were always interesting,
