Bron and I decided to go for a bushwalk to Mount St. Gwinear for Easter Sunday. It's about 120km from Melbourne, in the [Baw Baw National Park](http://www.parkweb.vic.gov.au/1park_display.cfm?park=44). The walk is 6km, and the guide [(pdf)](http://www.parkweb.vic.gov.au/resources/05_0611.pdf) estimates it at about 3 hours.

We arrived to find about 6 inches of snow, and two police officers waiting for a search party who were bringing down a walker who'd spent an unplanned (and rather cold) night out in the snow!

Despite not being prepared for the snow (we had raincoats, but not really suitable footwear), we decided to give the walk to Mt. St. Gwinear a go. It turned out to be a fairly easy walk even in the snow, in the dry it would probably only take about an hour.

The view from the top was pretty good, we had a bit of lunch, and then made a snowman, which Bron dubbed 'Claire'.

We didn't have any gloves, so Claire was pretty small...

And, of course, the odd snowball got thrown...

Luckily the weather stayed fine, in fact it warmed up quite a bit and the snow began to melt making it hard to keep our feet dry. It turned out to be a really nice walk, even with the wet feet on the way back.
