As I've become more serious about aikido I've found myself wanting to write more about it. To that end I have started writing the occasional blog entries under the name [avparker](http://wazajournal.com/author/avparker) on [Aikido Waza Journal](http://wazajournal.com).

I don't really expect anyone to read what I write, it's more for my own benefit, but there's a lot of  great info there by other contributors. In particular [Eric](http://wazajournal.com/students/eric.html), who runs the site, posts an amazing amount of material.
