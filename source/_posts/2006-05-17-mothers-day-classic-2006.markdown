On Sunday my family ran in the [2006 Mothers Day Classic](http://www.mothersdayclassic.org/event-details/melbourne) in Melbourne.

Last year we all entered the 4km run (except Dad, who was away). This year I entered the 8km run, mainly because I thought there would be less people in that event, but also because Dad was running 8km, and I couldn't let him run twice as far as me!

It turned out that [17,000 people](http://www.mothersdayclassic.org/2006/05/15/post-event-report-3/) entered the event in one form or another, and even in the 8km run was very crowded. The first few hundred metres were barely a more than walking pace, and most of the first kilometer was a slow jog. Definitely not an event to really test your times unless you can grab a spot right at the front of the start-line. But it was probably a good thing in the end, since my "training" (yeah, right!) didn't go so great because of a cold 2 weeks before the event. I ended up keeping a steady pace up till the 6km mark, at which point I was still feeling really good, and pushed the last 2km quite hard. So my time wasn't great, but I was happy with how it turned out, especially considering it was the first time I've run 8km.

Overall it was a good event, we all managed to finish okay and had a bit of fun :-)
