Congratulations to [Michael](http://www.softwareas.com) for the announcement of his new book [Ajax Design Patterns](http://www.softwareas.com/ajax-design-patterns-book)!

Michael has been beavering away working on [ajaxpatterns.org](http://ajaxpatterns.org/) for a while now, and it's nice to see all the work paying off for him. The book is still in progress, but you can follow along (and even contribute) on the [ajaxpatterns.org](http://ajaxpatterns.org/) wiki. I look forward to reading the finished book!
