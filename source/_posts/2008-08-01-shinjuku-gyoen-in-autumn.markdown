Living in Tokyo has made me realise how many nice parks there are in Melbourne. There are definitely fewer in Tokyo, so we are quite lucky to live very close to one of the biggest - 新宿御苑 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinjuku_Gyoen">Shinjuku Gyoen</a>). The park has a few different styles, and is very popular on the weekends, especially during spring (cherry blossom season) and autumn (when the leaves change colour).

Here are some pictures taken in December 2007, when the leaves were changing colours. The rest of the photos are in <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/avparker/ShinjukuGyoenJapan">this album</a>.
