___January 25th, 2009___: It's finally time to post the remainder of my search. I've faked the post dates to match when they were found.

I found 2 of the remaining "minimoos" with the help of the [map](http://www.cowparade-tokyo.com/map.html). They were on the third floor of the Marunouchi building, in quite a nice spot overlooking the autumn sunshine outside.
