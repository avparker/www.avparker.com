A few months ago I started using [bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com) to aggregate RSS feeds.
The result? 

{% avpimgcenter /wp-content/bloglinessummary.png '136 unread articles in bloglines' %}

_81_ feeds, and __136__ articles I've kept unread because I haven't had a chance to read yet! I've noticed that I now spend about an hour a day _just reading the new entries_, and despite a concerted effort to try to clear the backlog, I'm getting further behind.

Will the growth of RSS lead to yet another form of [information overload](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20031119/0246255_F.shtml)?
