Back at the end of May I was lucky enough to participate in the 49th All Japan Aikido Demonstration.

This year I took [lots of photos](https://picasaweb.google.com/avparker/2011052849thAllJapanAikidoDemonstration). Here are a couple of photos of my teachers for Advanced Academy:

<strong>Advanced Academy Demonstration</strong>

This was my third time taking part of the demonstration (last year I was in the demo for the [Intermediate Academy]({{root_url}}/2010/10/14/aikikai-hombu-dojo-tokyo-intermediate-gakko/) and in 2009 it was for the [Beginners Academy]({{root_url}}/2010/03/01/aikikai-hombu-dojo-beginners-gakko/) ). This years theme was yokomenuchi.

I've uploaded a video of the demonstration to [my youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/avparker440).

It's strange seeing myself doing techniques and taking ukemi, but a great opportunity for me to learn what I'm doing wrong and hopefully improve both. There is another [video from another angle](http://www.youtube.com/embed/TcHJQ5BtieY) uploaded by [yoshi23yama](http://www.youtube.com/user/yoshi23yama).

My partner for the demonstration was Nakano San, and as usual it was a great pleasure to train with her. 中野さん、ありがとうございました！また宜しくお願いします！

I was also very lucky that my friends took some photos of our demonstration, and they turned out great. 園部さん、納土さん、写真と動画を撮ってくれてありがとうございました！

Finally, I also updated [last years post](/2010/05/29/48th-all-japan-aikido-demonstration/) with a [video of the Intermediate Academy Demonstration, 2010](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PinoD6s60Mc).
