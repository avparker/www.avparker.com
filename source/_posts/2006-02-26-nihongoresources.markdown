A friend recently told me about [nihongoresources.com](http://www.nihongoresources.com). It looks like it has a number of things of interest to students of the Japanese language:

##### Beginners Lessons
12 lessons for complete beginners (currently only the first 4 are done). 
Looks like you need to spend a bit of time getting confortable with hiragana and katakana first, which is intimidating but I think is definitely a good idea.

##### Dictionaries
General Japanese-English and English-Japanese dictionaries, as well as dictionaries for kanji, names, particles, and even [onomatopoeia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onomatopoeia).
These are (of course) based off the work of [Jim Breen](http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/%7Ejwb/), who provides the excellent [wwwjdic](http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/jwb/wwwjdic?1C) that I currently use.

##### Jouyou kanji lists
The _1945_ standard kanji that Japanese are supposed to learn by the time they finish high school. The lists are broken into levels 1-6, plus general use, and the site allows you to customise the amount of information shown about each kanji (currently only level 1 allows customisation).

But the highlight of the site (at least for me)...

##### Grammar Book
An amazing ___Introduction to Japanese Syntax, Grammar and Language___ that's __285 pages long__, and must have taken a huge amount of effort to produce.
Based on the author's study of Japanese at University, it looks like a very useful reference, especially for intermediate or advanced students. I'll be using this to try to check and re-enforce my understanding of some of the tricky areas of the language (most of it really!). If only I knew enough _English<_ grammar to understand all the terms he uses!

You can download a [pdf copy](http://www.nihongoresources.com/downloads/An%20introduction%20to%20Japanese.pdf) from the "books" section of the site, or read it [online](http://www.nihongoresources.com/language/grammar.html).

Well worth a look...

As always, __がんばってね！__

__Updated May 2007:__ as Pomax (the author of the site) notes, the onomatopoeia dictionary is his own work. I've also updated the online link to the grammar book.
