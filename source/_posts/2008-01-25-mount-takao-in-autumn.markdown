Bron and I went to 高尾山 (Mount Takao) during autumn. 高尾山 is about 45 minutes west of Tokyo by train, so it's really easy to get to. There were lots of people there, but most of them took the cable-car to near the top so at least the trail wasn't too crowded. We took the side trail up and the main path down, which was a good move as the side path had some nice spots to rest and enjoy the view, and also has some variation in incline (the main path is uphill all the way).
