Today I noticed something a little strange near my work - a life-sized statue of a cow.

I saw another one close by, so I decided to have a closer look...

A few years ago I saw something similar in Tulsa (that time is was life-sized penguins), so I figured they were part of some sort of charity event. Sure enough, at the base of the statue was a metal plate with a number and information about the statue.

The statues are part of the [2008 Tokyo Cow Parade](http://www.cowparade-tokyo.com/) (the site is in Japanese but there is an English description [here](http://www.cowparade-tokyo.com/english/about.html)).

I found one other rather unusual cow statue during my lunch break:

In total there are a total of __73__ statues scattered around Marunouchi, so I decided it would be interesting to try to find them all!

Cows found today: 30, 18, 17.<br/>
Total cows found to date: __3 of 73__.

__Note:__ there is a [map](http://www.cowparade-tokyo.com/map.html) ([english version](http://www.cowparade-tokyo.com/english/map.html)) showing the locations of all the cows. I'm __not__ using the map, just seeing how many I can find. It's more fun that way, really!

__Update:__ The rest of the blog entries for the cow-hunt will be tagged with [tokyo-cow-parade]({{root_url}}/{{site.category_dir}}/tokyo-cow-parade/), and all the photos can be seen in my [picasa gallery](http://picasaweb.google.com/avparker/TokyoCowParade2008Japan).
