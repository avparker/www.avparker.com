2011 has been an interesting year so far, especially in my aikido. I thought it would be good to post a summary of the year so far, and compare it to [last year]({{root_url}}/2010/12/30/aikido-training-2010-summary/).

### Training Summary

I trained a total of __136.5 hours__ in the first 6 months of 2011, a nice improvement over the 102 hours in same period in 2010. I would have liked to train more, but I did manage to train regularly, making it to the dojo 3 or 4 days every week, except for the 3 weeks I was away.

### Shodan test

I began the year training 5 or 6 days a week, in preparation for [1][my shodan (black belt) test]. I received my Shodan certificate in late February.

### All shaken up

A few weeks later, on 11th March,  life in Japan became a whole lot different, due to the massive [Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_T%C5%8Dhoku_earthquake_and_tsunami). The earthquake itself was quite scary, I was on the 29th floor at work and the building swayed and creaked a lot, but thankfully the damage in Tokyo was minimal (unlike the devastation up north). I went to aikido training as normal the morning following the earthquake, there were only 7 students in beginners class.

More scary was the news of the [damage to the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_Daiichi_Nuclear_Power_Plant#Nuclear_disaster_of_2011), and then the completely empty shelves at the supermarket.

A few days later I made the decision to take an unplanned 2 week vacation and head down to Kyoto, unsure if I'd ever return. Thankfully disaster was averted, and life in Tokyo had _mostly_ returned to normal after the 2 weeks, apart from power cuts which luckily didn't affect me too much. The two weeks off had given me a chance to recover from the harder training I'd been doing before my black belt test, and I was eager to get back into training.

### The new normal

Training at Hombu Dojo soon returned to normal. I have been able to train 3 or 4 days a week since the beginning of April, and even though I'd like to train more this has been my limit, factoring in work and injuries. Getting used to wearing a hakama was difficult, but I mostly don't notice it any more. I'm enrolled in my second semester of "Advanced Gakko", and I get called up to take ukemi quite a lot during class, which I enjoy immensely. The Shinjuku Sports Center Dojo reopened again in June, after being closed as part of the power saving measures, and it's great to train there again.

### Aikido highlights

+ [My shodan test]({{root_url}}/2011/04/09/my-aikido-shodan-test/) - undoubtedly the highlight of my year.
+ Taking lots of ukemi for my teachers in Advanced Gakko (Kobayashi Sensei and Katsurada Sensei).
+ Taking part in the [49th All Japan Aikido Demonstration]({{root_url}}/2011/07/03/49th-all-japan-aikido-demonstration/) as part of the Advanced Gakko class.
+ Being called up as uke twice in ippan class (3rd floor at Hombu), the first time by Toriumi Sensei, the second time by Kobayashi Sensei. I was very surprised and honoured both times.
+ Taking ukemi for a shodan test at the Shinjuku Sports Center dojo in June. 石井さん、昇段おめでとうございます～！ 

Aikido is still a regular part of my life, and for that I'm grateful.
