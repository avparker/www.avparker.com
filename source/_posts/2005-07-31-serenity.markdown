I'm kinda surprised [M1K3Â¥](http://blog.m1k3y.com/) hasn't blogged this. A couple of weeks ago there was a preview screening of [serenity](http://www.serenitymovie.com.au) in Melbourne.

Serenity can be viewed as a standalone movie, but is based on the TV series [Firefly][1], by Joss Whedon (of Buffy & Angel fame). Unfortunately Firefly was cancelled mid-season (after being partially aired out of order!), but the whole season is available on DVD.

To keep this vaguely on-topic, one of the interesting aspects in Firefly/Serenity is the mixture of English & Chinese. This is largely illustrated by the use of Chinese to replace swearing, but it is indicated that in the Firefly universe (set in the year 2517) English/Chinese bilinguality is the norm.

No spoilers here, but I will say I enjoyed the movie a lot (more than most movies I've seen this year).
[Serenity](http://www.serenitymovie.com.au) is out in Australia on September 30. Go see it!
