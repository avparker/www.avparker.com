Yesterday I went to see the [sumo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumo) for the first time.

The Rikishi (sumo competitors) look amazing in their ceremonial Mawashi.

The crowd was really getting into it because the tournament is quite close - three rikishi were tied for first place on 10 wins, and Hakuko, the only current Yokozuna (grand champion) was one behind with 9 wins.

Here's the final match, between Hakuyo and Baruto.

The leaders all won their matches so the tournament will be decided today.
