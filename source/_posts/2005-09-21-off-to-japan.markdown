Tomorrow morning I'm flying to Japan for 5 weeks. 

After a few days sightseeing, I'll be spending 2 weeks home-staying with the Tanaka family (田中さんたち）, and attending the Ishikawa Foundation for International Exchange (IFIE). I hope to write a little more about my experiences.

After that, I'm spending about 2 weeks travelling in Japan.
I guess this is the first real test of my "classroom" Japanese!

それでは、またね！
