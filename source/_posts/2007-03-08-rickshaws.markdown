{% avpimgcenter /wp-content/rickshaws.jpg 450 337 'Rickshaws in front of Cheong Fatt Tze Mansion in Penang' %}

This photo was taken at [Cheong Fatt Tze Mansion](http://www.virtualmalaysia.com/destination/cheong%20fatt%20tze%20mansion.html) in Penang on my (not-so-recent) trip to Singapore/Malaysia/Thailand in November last year. The blue color was created using the crushed petals of a local flower, in an attempt to match the original 19th century color. The mansion was recently restored, and is now a functioning guest house and is open for tours. It was also used as a setting for the movie 'Indochine'.

PS: I know the photo is small. I will _eventually_ get a photo gallery set up with a larger version (and some more photos!).

__Update:__ A full-size version of this photo is now [available for purchase](http://www.redbubble.com/people/avparker/art/)!
