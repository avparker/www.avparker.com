During the [cow parade]({{root_url}}/{{site.category_dir}}/tokyo-cow-parade/) there was a temporary "shop" in the the Marunouchi building. They were selling model cows, of various designs from previous cow parades. They even had plain "paint-your-own" cows for those frustrated artists among us.

I'd like to see a real-life version of that!
