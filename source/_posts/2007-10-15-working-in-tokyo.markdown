After many years of thinking about it, I've finally made the move and started work in Japan. I'm working for an american investment bank in Tokyo (right near Tokyo station), so I won't be speaking too much Japanese at work, but hopefully I'll get to practice a bit.

Here's the view from my temporary accommodation in Roppongi. That's Tokyo tower in the background.
