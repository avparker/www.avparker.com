Last night I went to see [Cory  Doctorow](http://craphound.com/) speaking at ACMI for [a fireside chat with cory doctorow](http://www.acmi.net.au/BA17967BB1424924A6D041E3BE89423E.jsp).

Cory talked about culture, copyright, and [DRM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Rights_Management). Specifically, he talked about some of the crazy things the entertainment industry are doing, and how this indicates their business models aren't in very good shape.

### Some signs your business model is crap:

+ suing your customers ( [RIAA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIAA#File-sharing_controversy) )
+ locking in your customers ( [Apple](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FairPlay#Restrictions) )
+ removing features customers have paid for ( [TIVO](http://www.pvrblog.com/pvr/2005/09/tivo_72_os_adds.html) )
+ highjacking your customers computers by installing root-kits ( [Sony](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_Sony_CD_copy_protection_controversy) )
+ competing to see who can have the most restrictive DRM ( [Blu-ray](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluray#Digital_rights_management) and [HD-DVD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD_DVD#Copy_restriction_technology) )

Cory's an excellent speaker, and he's obviously passionate about the topic. His [published books](http://craphound.com/novels.php) are also available under the [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) license, and he has worked for the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](http://www.eff.org/), among other things. If you get a chance to see him speak, I'd thoroughly  recommend it.

But the best bit about the night? [M1K3Â¥](http://blog.m1k3y.com/) and Cory had [met](http://www.flickr.com/photos/m1k3y/129212682/) at [conjure](http://blog.m1k3y.com/?p=603), so I got to tag along and have a drink and a chat with Cory and his girlfriend after the lecture!
