Despite my intentions, I categorically failed to update this blog in 2009. So I thought I'd give a quick list of some of the memorable moments of the year. I'm sure I'll forget lots, this is just what comes to mind.

### 合気道 - Aikido

I'm happy to say started training again in [Aikido]({{root_url}}/2006/03/16/the-way-of-harmony/) at [合気会本部道場](http://www.aikikai.or.jp/jpn/index.htm) ([Aikikai Hombu Dojo](http://www.aikikai.or.jp/eng/index.htm)) in Shinjuku in late 2008. I had stopped training in Melbourne after only 3 months, which I will always regret. I started training once a week, but now train 3 or 4 times when possible. My classes are completely in Japanese, which is another plus.

+ February - Completed my first semester of Beginners Course in <a href="http://www.aikikai.or.jp/eng/hombu/academy.htm">Aikido Gakkou</a> and passed my first grading, to become <a href="http://www.aikikai.or.jp/jpn/shinsayoko.htm">４級</a> (<a href="http://www.aikikai.or.jp/eng/gradingsystem.htm">4th Kyuu</a>).
+ April - Attended the annual Aiki-Jinja Festival in Iwama, where O'Sensei lived for most of his later life.
+ May - participated in the 47th All Japan Aikido Demonstration at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nippon_Budokan">Nippon Budokan</a> with my classmates from Beginners Course. I'm sure no-one watched us, but it sure was fun!
+ August - Completed my second semester of Beginners Course in <a href="http://www.aikikai.or.jp/eng/hombu/academy.htm">Aikido Gakkou</a>, and passed my grading for <a href="http://www.aikikai.or.jp/jpn/shinsayoko.htm">３級</a> (<a href="http://www.aikikai.or.jp/eng/gradingsystem.htm">3th Kyuu</a>).
+ October - Began my first semester of Intermediate Course in <a href="http://www.aikikai.or.jp/eng/hombu/academy.htm">Aikido Gakkou</a>.
+ Trained in the regular (i.e. non-beginners) class for my first time on Christmas Day - the last day of training for the year.
+ Saw in the New Year with 越年稽古 (New Years Eve Practice) at the dojo.

### 日本語 - Japanese

I've been learning for a number of years, but I'm still intermediate level. I felt like I improved quite a bit in 2009.

+ Read my first manga series completely in Japanese - <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEATH_NOTE">デスノート</a>　(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Note">Death Note</a>).
+ July - __Passed 日本語能力試験２級 (JLPT Level 2)__.
+ Began watching Japanese tv shows with _Japanese_ subtitles. Depending on the show I understand anywhere from 50-90%.
+ Sometimes at aikido training I forget the teacher is speaking in Japanese.
+ Finally started to feel like I can speak a little. It's still frustrating a lot of the time, speaking is definitely harder than listening and reading.

### 色々 - miscellaneous

+ Unfortunately not much traveling around Japan, but there's plenty to see and do in and around Tokyo.
+ Finally bought a digital SLR - a Nikon D90
+ Hired a dog for a day.
+ Ran 10km for the <a href="http://www.runforthecure.org">Run for the Cure</a>.

### Holiday in Bali

Spent just over a week relaxing in Bali. The weather was amazing, 32 degrees and sunny every day. Thanks to Bron for finding such fantastic places to stay!

### Became an uncle
