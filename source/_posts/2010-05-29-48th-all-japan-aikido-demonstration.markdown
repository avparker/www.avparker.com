On Saturday I attended the 48th All Japan Aikido Demonstration (第48回 全日本合気道演武大会) at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nippon_Budokan">Nippon Budokan</a>, commonly call the "Embu". It's the biggest event of the year for <a href="http://www.aikikai.or.jp/index.html">Aikikai</a>, with people coming from all over Japan (and from overseas) to attend. It's even professionally recorded by NHK, and you can buy a 2-disc DVD set covering the teachers demonstrations (get the <a href="http://www.aikikai.or.jp/jpn/publication/video/enbu/enbu.htm">2009 edition here</a>). Eric wrote a bit more about <a href="http://ericrch.wordpress.com/2009/05/24/the-47th-all-japan-aikido-demonstration/">last years event</a>, and again <a href="http://ericrch.wordpress.com/2010/05/23/48th-all-japan-aikido-demonstration/">this year</a>. I thought I'd post some photos and write a little about my experience.

### Intermediate Class Demonstration

For the second year running I've also been lucky enough to <strong>participate</strong> in the demonstration, as a part of the [Aikido Gakkou]({{root_url}}/2010/03/01/aikikai-hombu-dojo-beginners-gakko/) at <a href="http://www.aikikai.or.jp/index.html">Hombu Dojo</a>. This year I was part of the demonstration for [Intermediate Gakkou]({{root_url}}/2010/10/14/aikikai-hombu-dojo-tokyo-intermediate-gakko/).

The upcoming Embu had been the focus of our training in Intermediate Gakko for about the last 3 weeks or so. We were told our demonstration would be 2 minutes, and held at the same time as the Beginners Gakko and Advanced Gakkou classes. We were asked to pair up, and I was very happy to have Shishido san, my partner for the demonstration last year, as my partner again this year.

We spent a large part of our preparation time in the Gakkou classes on the appropriate etiquette - where and how we were to line up to enter the floor, the correct bows before the waza, waiting for the taiko drum before starting, where to position ourselves on the mat, bowing correctly after the waza, and where to leave the tatami.

Our teachers also prescribed the techniques we would be performing, and our classes have been mostly restricted to those techniques for the last few weeks:
<div style="text-align:centre;">
<table>
<tr>
<td>正面打　入身投げ</td><td>shoumenuchi iriminage</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>横面打　四方投げ</td><td>yokomenuchi shihoge</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>両手取　天地投げ</td><td>ryoutedori techinage</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>片手取　内回転投げ</td><td>katatedori uchikaitennage</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>突　小手返し</td><td>tsuki kotegaeshi</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>


We found it pretty hard to get through that list in 2 minutes, but the practice gave us a good chance to "polish" our techniques a bit, and in our final week of practice my partner and I had been getting fairly consistent at finishing the final technique around the 2 minute mark while hopefully not looking too rushed. We were also told that someone would be video'ing the demonstration, which provided a little extra "incentive" to practice hard.

### Intermediate Demonstration - The Mixup!

Despite all the instruction on etiquette, or perhaps because of it, things didn't quite go as planned on the day. We had been explicitly told by <em>both teachers</em> that we were not to start our waza until the taiko (drum) to sound <strong>after</strong> we had bowed.
We dutifully filed onto the tatami and lined up in seiza as instructed, waiting to be told to bow to shomen (the front). Unfortunately the taiko sounded <strong>before</strong> we were told to bow to shomen, and <strong>not after</strong>, leaving our entire class sitting waiting while the other groups had started their demonstrations. Finally someone yelled out that we should start, and a confused bunch of Intermediate Class students scrambled to start. I'm sure it looked a little ridiculous from the stands. Due to the delay starting Kan and I didn't <em>quite</em> finish, I was just about to start my final kotegaeshi when the Taiko drum went. I think we also managed to perform okay, especially given the distraction of the late start.

### More Demonstrations

After our demonstration everyone hurried back upstairs so we could watch the demonstrations of the Hombu Dojo Senseis. I got a couple of photos, so I'll make another post and including some from last year. After the Hombu teachers, a couple of us went to look at the dogi and hakama which were on sale. I've been training 4-5 times a week and having only 2 dogi has been a bit awkward, so I bought a summer dogi which should help a bit, not to mention be more comfortable in the upcoming heat - there's no aircon at hombu dojo!
Quite a few of my classmates stayed until the final demonstrations by Tada Shihan (9th Dan) and the Doshu (the head of Aikikai).

It was a great day, although it seemed to go far too quickly. Not only were the teachers amazing, but the ukemi was superb.
