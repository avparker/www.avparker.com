___January 31st, 2009___: It's finally time to post the remainder of my search. I've faked the post dates to match when they were found.

Today I finally found the remaining [cows]({{root_url}}/{{site.category_dir}}/tokyo-cow-parade/). The final 3 "mini-moos" were spread through the upper floors in the Oazu building, so were almost impossible to find without the map. The final cow was on the other side of the JR Tokyo station, which I'm pretty sure isn't actually Marunouchi.
