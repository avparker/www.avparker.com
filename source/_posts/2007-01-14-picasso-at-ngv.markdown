Last year Bron and I went to see the [Picasso](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picasso) exhibition at the [NGV International](http://ngv.vic.gov.au/ngvinternational/). I didn't know much about Picasso, but the exhibition was pretty interesting. A large part of it was actually about Picasso's muse [Dora Maar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dora_Maar). They even had ipods with an audio guide available for hire.

Here's a couple of pictures I took that night.
