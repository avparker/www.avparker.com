This week is my fourth week as a student of [aikido](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aikido) (合気道).

__合__ - harmony <br/>
__気__ - spirit/power <br/>
__道__ - way/path

Aikido, which can be translated as "Way of Harmony with Ki", was developed during the middle of the 20th Century by [O'Sensei Morihei Ueshiba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morihei_Ueshiba) (植芝盛平) - by all reports an incredible man.

Aikido is a martial art, and while it could be used to injure other people, the focus is on neutralising (potentially multiple) attackers, and as such it is very effective for self-defence. In fact, O'Sensei was a [deeply spiritual man](http://www.gardenstateaikikai.com/quotes.htm), and an important facet of aikido is the corresponding responsibility given the potential for injury that comes with the knowledge of aikido techniques.

I'm studying aikido at [aikidojo](http://www.iwamaaikido.com.au/) in West Melbourne. Aikidojo practices the [Iwama Style](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iwama_Ryu) of aikido, which is based on maintaining the aikido as taught by O'Sensei to [Sensei Morihiro Saito](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morihiro_Saito) in Iwama, the spiritual home of Aikido (the home of both the Iwama dojo and the Aiki shrine).

Aikidojo is not a large dojo, but there is an incredible level of experience among the members. I went to dinner after one class and by my rough estimate the cumulative experience of the six senior members at the table was around 65 years! I'm very lucky that I get the chance to learn in that environment!

Even after a short time, it's definitely clear to me that aikido is not something you ever "master". Rather it's something that will always involve learning on many levels.

I think that's one of the things that I find most compelling about it.
