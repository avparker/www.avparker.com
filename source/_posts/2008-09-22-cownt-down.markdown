After checking through my list of [cows]({{root_url}}/{{site.category_dir}}/tokyo-cow-parade/), and I have the following left to find: __10, 12, 37, 64, 66, 67, 71, 72, 73__. The last five are all '_minimoo_'s.

I went looking for number 37 today, since cows 32-36 were all in or around the Marunouchi building. After spending about 15 minutes looking around I asked at the reception, and sure enough, it was on the 5th floor. Cow 37 was quite unusual, it had been split in half and then put in what looked like two semi-transparent shipping crates!

So while we were there we tried out Kua Aina, a Hawaiian burger chain. Nice burger, a bit pricey.
