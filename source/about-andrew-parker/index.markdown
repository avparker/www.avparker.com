I’m a Software Engineer with extensive experience in Java and C++, and an interest in agile development. I received my B. Eng. (hons) and B. Sc. (physics) from The University of Melbourne. I’m currently living in Tokyo and working for a US Investment Bank.

I’m learning Aikido at Aikikai Hombu Dojo (Tokyo), I got my black belt in February 2011. I’m also learning Japanese, and passed JLPT Level 2 in 2009.
