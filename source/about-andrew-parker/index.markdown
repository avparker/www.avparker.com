I’m a programmer with an interest in agile development and programming languages. I received my B.Eng. (software w/ honours) and B.Sc. (physics) from [The University of Melbourne](http://www.unimelb.edu.au/) in 1997. I have extensive commercial experience in the telecommunications and finance industries, primarily in Java and C++.

I’ve been living and working in Tokyo since 2007. I train in [Aikido (合気道)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aikido) at [Aikikai Hombu Dojo](http://aikikai.or.jp). I received my shodan (black belt) in February 2011, and my nidan in December 2013. I speak conversational Japanese, and passed [JLPT](http://www.jees.or.jp/jlpt/en/index.htm) Level 2 in 2009.
